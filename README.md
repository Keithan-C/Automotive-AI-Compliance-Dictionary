## 📌 Overview
In the era of the **Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV)**, the greatest bottleneck isn't writing code—it's ensuring that **Business & Regulatory Requirements** are accurately translated into **Functional, Compliant Algorithms**.

This repository serves as a "Rosetta Stone" for the **VDI Wissensforum** ecosystem, specifically tailored for the **ELIV (Electronics In Vehicles)** tracks:
* **AI & Autonomous Driving**
* **Cyber Security (UN R155/156)**
* **Software-Defined-Architecture**

## 📖 The "Requirement-to-Code" Mapping

We translate high-level industry "Talk" into low-level engineering "Walk."

| Business Requirement (The "What") | Engineering Logic (The "How") | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Safety-First AI** | `Deterministic Execution` | Eliminating non-deterministic race conditions in perception stacks. |
| **Cyber Resilience** | `Secure Boot & OTA` | Hardware-backed signature verification for all firmware updates. |
| **SDV Scalability** | `Hardware Abstraction Layer` | Decoupling $App_{logic}$ from $ECU_{drivers}$ via middleware APIs. |
| **AI Act Compliance** | `Traceable ML Pipelines` | Automated logging of training data lineage and weight versioning. |

## 🛠 Usage for VDI Program Committees
This dictionary is designed to help **Project Leads** and **Technical Chairs** vet the depth of speaker content. 

If a presentation claims to cover **"AI Safety,"** this repo provides the benchmark for whether the session will address the actual **Code-Level Determinism** required for ASIL-D certification.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Networking
This project is maintained with the **Greater Dusseldorf and Ingolstadt** automotive clusters in mind. 

**Are you organizing a track for ELIV 2026?** We are looking to contribute this framework to sessions focused on:
1. **The Future of SDV Middleware**
2. **Automating Compliance for AI-Driven Perception**
